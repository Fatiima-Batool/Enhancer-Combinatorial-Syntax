Title of study: Motif Grammar Discovery of Human Forebrain-Specific Enhancers


> Purpose: This python script was designed to perform the Market Basket Analysis (MBA) to study the co-occurrence of the transcription factors HES5, FOXP2, and GATA in a set of functional enancers using Apriori algorithm.

> Operating system:
Windows 10 (64 bit)

> Programming language:
Python version 3.12.1

> Run code:
Open command prompt
Navigate to the directory containing "code.py" by entering "cd path\to\your\script"
run the script by entering "python code.pl"

> Input files:
This code takes txt file as an input that contains a binary matrix where presence of TFs is marked as 1 (True)and absence is marked as 0 (False) across each row containing individual enhancers ID. 

> Output:
This code will creat an output file in txt format containing metrics like support, confidence and lift to evaluate the strength and significance of TFs associations.
