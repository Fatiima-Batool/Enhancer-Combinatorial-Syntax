# Motif Grammar Discovery of Human Forebrain-Specific Enhancers

## Purpose
This Python script identifies CRMs containing specific regulatory grammar in a given dataset. It focuses on CRMs with the heterotypic binding module "HES5-FOXP2-GATA3," a candidate motif grammar for forebrain-specific enhancers.

## Operating System
- Windows 10 (64-bit)

## Programming Language
- Python 3.12.1

## Running the Code
1. Open Command Prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `code.py`:
   ```sh
   cd path\to\your\script
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python Code.py
   ```

## Input Files
- This code takes txt file as an input that contains a unique identifier (CRM ID) for each CRM, and detailed transcription factor binding profile.



## Output Files
- This code will generate an output file in .txt format, containing all the CRM IDs with the specified motif grammar of "HES5-FOXP2-GATA3".
